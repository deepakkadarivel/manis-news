                                <h5>MAHA SHIVARATHRI</h5>
                                <p style="font-size: 16px">Maha Shivarathri, the night of the worship of Shiva, occurs on the 14th night of the new moon during the dark half of the month of Phalguna (Feb / March) when Hindus offer special prayer to the lord of destruction. The absolute formless God, Sadashiv appeared in the form of "Lingodbhav Moorti" exactly at midnight on Maha Shivratri. That is why all devotees keep vigil during the night of Shivratri and do "Shivlingam abhishekham" (coronation of the phallic idol)at midnight.</p>

                            <p>Lord Shiva was married to Devi Parvati on Shivarathri. Remember Shiva minus Parvati is pure 'Nirgun Brahman'. With his illusive power, (Maya, Parvati) he becomes the "Sagun Brahman" for the purpose of the pious devotion of his devotees. It is also believed that on Shivarathri, Lord Shiva became 'Neelkantham' or the blue-throated by swallowing the deadly poison that came up during the churning of "Kshir Sagar" or the milky ocean. The poison was so deadly that even a drop in his stomach, which represents the universe, would have annihilated the entire world. Hence, he held it in his neck, which turned blue due to the effect of poison. Shivratri is therefore also a day of thanksgiving to the Lord for protecting us from annihilation.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>There are many mythological legends associated with this day. According to a popular legend, when a hunter could not find anything to kill for his food in a forest, he waited on the branch of a Wood apple tree. In order to attract deer, he started throwing the leaves of the tree on the ground, unaware that there was a Shiva Lingam beneath the tree. Pleased with the Wood apple leaves and the patience of the hunter, it is believed that Lord Shiva appeared in front of the hunter and blessed him with wisdom. From that day onwards, the hunter stopped eating meat.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Generally it is believed that anyone who utters the name of Shiva during Shivratri with pure devotion is freed from all sins. He or she reaches the abode of Shiva and is liberated from the cycle of birth and death. The Shiva is called the Lingam. It is usually made of granite, soapstone, quartz, marble or metal.Devotees circumnavigate the lingam and worship it throughout the night. Abhishekam will be done on every three hours with the 5 sacred offerings of a cow, called the 'panchagavya' milk, sour milk, urine, butter and dung. Then the 5 foods of immortality - milk, clarified butter, curd, honey and sugar are placed before the lingam. Datura fruit and flower, though poisonous, are believed to be sacred to Shiva and thus offered to him. All through the day the devotees keep severe fast, chant the sacred Panchakshara mantra "Om Namah Shivaya", make offerings of flowers and incense to the Lord amidst ringing of temple bells. They maintain long vigils during the night, keeping awake to listen to stories, hymns and songs. Meditation and chanting of the mantra 'Om Namah Shivaya' ,leaves of a forest tree Aegle marmelos(Bilwa) are traditionally used for pooja. Bilwa leaves have to be a stalk with three leaves on the belief that the goddess Mahalakshmi resides in them. The fast is broken only the next morning, after the nightlong worship. In Kashmir, the festival is held for 15 days. The 13th day is observed as a day of fast followed by a family feast. The people who fast on this night and offer prayers to Lord Shiva believed to bring good luck in their life.The Mahashivaratri fasting begins on the morning of Shivaratri and ends next day morning or the Amavasya morning. Since it is a long Upavasa or Vrata, many people consume a special meal known as ‘phalahara’.</p>

                            <p>All the rituals on the night of Shivaratri are meant to cleanse the ignorance and realize the Brahmachari Ajaya Chaitanyam manifest in you. The fasting, rituals and chanting are meant to kill desire, greed, illusion, arrogance, jealousy, and anger. This will make you a better person and prepare you to face the challenges. Most familiar places to celebrate Mahashivarathri : Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, Haridwar and Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, Srikalahasthi and Srisailam, Andhra Pradesh,Guwahati and Sibsagar, Assam, Khajuraho and Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, Puri,Orissa.</p>

                            <p>Nanjangudu is also called as "Dakshina
                                Kashi" (southern Kashi) The main temple at Nanjangudu is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, whose another name is Nanjundeshwara, Nanjundeshwara means the God who drank poison.The original Nanjundeshwara temple is said to be of Ganga period (325 - 1000 CE). This temple has then been renovated by the Hoysala kings. Both Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan had close associations with this temple. Wodeyar kings have provided various grants to renovate the temple. The temple was originally built by the Ganga rulers in the 9th century during their occupation of this region. The residing deity of the temple was later called Hakim Nanjundeswara; a title given by the Great Tippu Sultan who had faith in the God. It is said and inscribed in the temple history that his favourite and beloved elephant was bestowed with eyesight by the Lord, after Tippu Sultan's vow with the local deity.Near Nanjangudu is the sangam, where the Kapila and Kaundinya rivers meet. This place is termed as Parashurama Kshetra which is where the sage Parashurama is said to have cleansed himself from the sin of beheading his mother. A small rivulet called Suvarnavathy also joins the rivers here and it is said that Parashurama got immense peace of mind at this place which he did not get anywhere else. Anyhow Peoples believing that Lord Shiva is a destroyer of negativity on earth, Lord Shiva represents the most essential goddess he destruction and in the postive sense of destroying ego. Om Namha Shivaya</p>

                                <p>In Karnataka, 30 Jilla panchayath and 175 Taluk Panchayath election was held on 13th February 2016 and 20th February 2016 respectively by two stages and the Election result was declared on 23rd February 2016. In this Election, Congress won 10 Districts, BJP - 07, JDS - 02 and Other Independent - 11. In Taluk Panchayath, Congress and BJP won 56 seats each followed by JDS with 19 and Other Independent 44. Nearly 70% of the votes were polled in this election and it is a good performance by the public but People have not given any absolute majority to any of the political parties and Independent. The effect of this will only be faced by the public. The cause of internal political problems is because of the party who were elected by the public with majority and the party which will not be able to get the real co operation from State and Central governments. When Jilla and Talluk Panchayath leaders fail to get the needed fund from the government on time, the leaders cannot fulfil the election promises made to public. The ruling party of Congress failed in majority places in this election because of somuchinternalcomplications and competition between second stage leaders and party workers.</p>

                                    Thus our conclusion regarding this would be, those who are the in the first level leadership like Minister’s, MP’s MLA’s,MLC’s fail to reach public with their government achievements because they do not have an understanding while selecting the candidates. More than that, there is no more Assembly election or Parliament election until 2018. There is another chance of 2years for Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to prove his governance to the public. If a good governance reaches the public then CM can get good results from the public in future. Finally the results are in the hands of the public not in the Congress

                                    Coming to BJP, in the Second place in this election, they do not campaign aggressively and also the State President of BJP Prahlad Joshi does not have a regular touch with public even though the public have given some respective result to BJP. If BJP wants to overtake Congress in future, it is the question of who is going to be in charge of the state president post. The former Chief Minister Yediyurappa still familiar to public is an example for BJP high command to take proper decision while selecting candidate for the state president post after which there are chances to improve their vote banks and will be able to stand opposite Congress with right competition. Every decision is in the hands of BJP’s high command.

                                <p>Last and not the least, JDS is satisfied with the third position in this election with difficulty. JDS is only the decision factor of nearly 10 constituencies in this Jilla and Taluk panchayath election. Before this election they had so many complications among the JDS leaders, which are clearly shown in the Assembly by election. Under HD Kumaraswamy , they will able to come out of this gradually because people have good faith on Kumaraswamy. Regarding this, HD Kumaraswamy should take strong decision on the second level leaders of JDS and should join hands together with party workers to continue further steps. If everything goes fine again HD Kumaraswamy is the only game changer or King maker of state politics in Karnataka.</p>
